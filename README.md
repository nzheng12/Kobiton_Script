# Kobiton_Script1
Kobition Script Challenge
I used powershell for this following challenge. I set the content of the log to the variable $content and assign that to another variable called $text to find the string I am looking for. Used if and else statement depending if the string was found. Reused script for both logs with just slight adjustment of the path. I am not the best at powershell, but I am using powershell because it is what I am most familiar with.
